    <center><h1>Chapter 3: A New Race</h1></center>
    <center><p>As the story goes, the turtle and the rabbit had a race once again and the rabbit, as planned, won the race.
    The rabbit started boasting again about winning another race, now it was time for the turtle to do some thinking.
    Then, the turtle did some thinking again, he was trying to figure out why he had lost the race. When he was walking throught the forest to get home, 
    he saw an old wise turtle and asked him how he could rechallenge the rabbit so that he could win the next race. 
    The old wise turtle told the turtle that he needed to identify his strengths and his abilities, and then use them against the rabbit to defeat him.</p></center>

    boasting about his speed, then, he told the rabbit that he wanted to rechallenge him, but on a different track, the turtle chose a path in which had a river, and that was the trick.
    The rabbit could swim, and he used that against the rabbit, he was sure that no rabbit could swim. He tricked the rabbit into this, and the rabbit, unknowingly, agreed to the race.
