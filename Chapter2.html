    <center><h1>Chapter 2: The Race</h1></center>
    <p>It was time for the race, and the turtle was ready, so was the rabbit, the rabbit was sure that he was going to win.
    The referee said Go!, and the rabbit went full-speed towards the end of the race, he was only a few kilometers away
    so he decided to give the turtle a chance and he was so overconfident that he fell asleep, then the turtle, slowly walking towards
    the end, he saw the rabbit asleep and thought that power is useful, only when you have no ego about it, he finished the race and then he woke the rabbit.
    The rabbit said the race wasn't fair, and that he was faster, all the animals said it was a fair race and that he lost against the turtle.
    The rabbit did some thinking, and he realised that the reason he had lost was because of his overconfidence. He decided to rechallenge the turtle, and it was time he'd prove himself.
    The rabbit was quite smart, but the turtle was innocent and didn't know that the rabbit had understood his mistake.

    <center><p>Later that day, the rabbit went to the turtle to ask for another race, the turtle confidently agreed to another race. This time, he was going to go full speed. The turtle thought the rabbit was going to do the same thing again, but this time, it was different.
    The turtle said to have the race on the same path, but the rabbit said that it doesn't matter and that he was going to win.
    They decided to have it on the same path, the next day, all of the animals were coming to the race, and the rabbit was going to earn the trophy again, he was confident that the turtle will lose, let's see what happens.</p></center>
