    <center><p>On one sunny day in William Forest, the rabbit was talking about how he beat the lion<br>
    in a race near the river, after that, he said that he would accept anyone's challenge that wanted<br> 
    to have a race with him. The turtle heard him, and calmly accepted the challenge, the rabbit and all the other<br>
    animals laughed, how could a turtle beat the great rabbit, everyone questioned the turtle. The next day.....

        <p>As the turtle and the rabbit were discussing where to race, a fox came to the rabbit and said he wanted to talk in private, the rabbit
        agreed and they started talking, the fox said that the turtle was going to cheat and that he should be careful, the rabbit overconfidently said
        nothing would stop him in winning the prize. The rabbit then came back and said he wanted to race near the river where he beat the lion, the turtle agreed.
