    <center><h1>Chapter 4: The Cleverness of the Turtle</h1></center>

    <center><p>When the race started, the rabbit went on full speed as he planned. The turtle slowly walked like it wasn't a race, 
        and when the rabbit was running he saw a lake nearby, and he thought to himself how he could go past the river. The turtle got near the river
    and the rabbit just kept looking, because he didn't know what to do, slowly the turtle got past the river and walked his way to the finish line, and he won the race.</p></center>
